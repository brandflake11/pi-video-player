* Pi Video Player

This is a small script to help one quickly setup a Raspberry Pi 4 video player. It can be used for installation.

* How to Use

Run the script and follow the script's instructions:

#+NAME: Setup pi-video-player
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  git clone https://github.com/brandflake11/pi-video-player.git
  cd pi-video-player
  chmod +x setup.sh
  ./setup.sh
